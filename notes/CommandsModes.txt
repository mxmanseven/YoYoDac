let's start simple:

test ble with: chrome://bluetooth-internals/#devices/

1) Command/Mode
    two commands:
      1) download file
      2) zero distance and reset file
      
      
2) sample
    send all samples form file, one at a time. Clear file when done.
      it might be easier for client to pull all data 
      instead of doing notifications.
